        question: "Who are the founders behind Velouraz, and what is the brand's story?",
        answer: "Velouraz was born from a friendship transformed into a global journey. Best friends and founders, Zahabiya Kalabhai and Alifiya Bohra, found inspiration during their international travels. Their desire to bring the world's most captivating jewellery traditions into one cohesive collection led to the creation of Velouraz — a brand where the world becomes jewellery, and jewellery becomes part of your story."
    },
    {
        question: "What makes Velouraz jewellery globally curated?",

From the delicate artistry of Japanese Miyuki beads and luminous South Korean pearls to the ancient symbolism of Turkish stones, Australian opals, Chinese jade, Parisian elegance, and the rich Kundan and Polki heritage of India, we bridge global destinations with contemporary style."
    },
    {
